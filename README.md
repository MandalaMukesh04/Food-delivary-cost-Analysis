# Food Orders Data Analysis

## Overview
This is a data analysis project focused on food order data, extracting meaningful insights such as discount percentages and amounts. The project is implemented using Python and pandas for efficient data processing.

## Methodology
This project follows a structured analysis approach:

- **Data Loading**: Reads the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Inspection**: Uses `.head()` and `.info()` to understand data structure.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Converts "Delivery Date and Time" to a datetime format.
  - Extracts discount percentages from text-based descriptions.
  - Calculates discount amounts based on order values.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and inconsistent formats.
- **Discount Analysis**: Extracts and computes discount percentages and amounts.
- **Date Processing**: Converts and manipulates timestamps for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Add visualizations to explore order trends.
- Implement customer segmentation based on ordering patterns.
- Integrate machine learning for predictive analytics.
